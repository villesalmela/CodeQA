# Quality Code Lib
## Objective
This application will allow users to save their Python functions in a code library. The functions are searchable and browsable, publicly available for other users.
The application supports users in documentation and quality control of their functions.

## Features
### Registration
- Users can create new accounts using their email as username

### Saving new functions
- Users can save new functions to the library
- Application will do following checks and provide feedback
    - Linting using pylint
    - Type checking using mypy
    - Security checking using bandit
    - (Optional) Automated documentation using OpenAI API
    - (Optional) Automated generation of unit tests using OpenAI API
    - (Optional) Automated execution of unit tests using AWS Lambda
    - (Optional) Automated keyword classification using OpenAI API
- Users are given possibility to refine their code before saving, based on feedback
- Users can classify their functions using keywords

### Browsing and searching the library
- Users can search and view functions saved by other people
- Users can rate functions and sort by rating

### Library management
- Administrators can manage users and saved functions
- Users can remove their own saved functions

### TODO
- Add more static checkers (mypy, bandit)
- Implement search and rating functionality
- Improve user interface
- Address security considerations

## Testing
Application is packaged into docker container using Github Action, and uploaded to AWS ECR by the pipeline.
AWS AppRunner is serving the app, which is available at https://codeqa.online

To create an account, you need to use your university email address.

Test accounts are available:

Normal user:
- username: testuser@villesalmela.fi
- password: password

Administrator:
- username: testadmin@villesalmela.fi
- password: password

Please don't delete or disable admin account, you currently can't make more of them without direct DB access.

Couple of test functions were saved to the library using these inputs:
```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    fahrenheit = (9/5) * celsius + 32
    return fahrenheit
```

```python
def factorial(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError("Input must be an integer.")
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer.")
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

Feel free to try the process with these ones, or come up with something else.

### Local Testing
While you can run the web app and database locally, some components don't currently have local options.
1. Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
1. Install [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
1. Setup a PostgreSQL server
    - *ENV: DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_PASSWORD, DB_USER, DB_NAME*
1. Create a new [AWS VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-getting-started.html), which will be used to isolate the lambda function
    - Give it one subnet, and no access to other networks
1. Create a new [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html) function
    - *ENV: PYTEST_REGION*
    - Attach the lambda function to the newly created VPC
    - Modify the automatically created [execution role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro-execution-role.html), which the lambda function will assume
        - Set the role to have one policy, [AWSDenyALL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-managed-policy/latest/reference/AWSDenyAll.html). \
        This will limit any damage that can occur if malicious user manages to escape isolation. 
    - Upload the [code for the lambda function](aws/lambda/lambda_function.py)
    - Create a [resource based policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/access-control-resource-based.html) that allows invoking this lambda function
    - Create a user, and assign it the policy you just created
        - [Setup an access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)
        - *ENV: PYTEST_KEY_ID, PYTEST_KEY_SECRET*
1. Setup [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) key
    - *ENV: OPENAI_API_KEY*
1. Setup [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com) account
    - *ENV: MJ_APIKEY_PUBLIC, MJ_APIKEY_SECRET*
    - [create a template for transactional email](https://documentation.mailjet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042952713-Mailjet-s-Email-Editor-for-Transactional-Emails)
        - *ENV: MJ_TEMPLATE_ID*
    - the template must:
        - accept one variable: "VERIFICATION_CODE"
        - include default subject and sender
1. Clone this project to your workstation
